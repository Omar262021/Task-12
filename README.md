1-Movement Motors are selected by omar ahmed
the motor selcted is **Brushless** DC motors 

# **BLDC Advantages**:
High Efficiency: Because the motor has no brushes, internal friction is much lower, increasing energy efficiency.

Longer Lifespan: The lack of brushes means there are fewer parts to wear out over time, increasing the life of the motor.

Higher Speed: BLDC motors can reach higher rotational speeds than conventional DC motors.

Precise Control: The speed and torque of the motor can be better controlled using electronic control technology, making it suitable for applications that require precision control such as drones or electric cars.

* This Advantages will help us to control the movment because we will need a high speed and high control
