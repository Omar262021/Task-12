# Task-12.2
Select_Motors

1-Movement Motors are selected by omar ahmed
the motor selcted is **Brushless** DC motors 

# **BLDC Advantages**:
High Efficiency: Because the motor has no brushes, internal friction is much lower, increasing energy efficiency.

Longer Lifespan: The lack of brushes means there are fewer parts to wear out over time, increasing the life of the motor.

Higher Speed: BLDC motors can reach higher rotational speeds than conventional DC motors.

Precise Control: The speed and torque of the motor can be better controlled using electronic control technology, making it suitable for applications that require precision control such as drones or electric cars.

* This Advantages will help us to control the movment because we will need a high speed and high control

2- Dribbling Motors selected by Mahmoud Sameh

The selected motor is **Servo Motor**

servo motor would be a suitable solution for this task

## Advantages:

### 1-Precision Control:
Servo motors provide precise control over position, speed, and torque. This can be beneficial in maintaining accurate control over ball movement and providing smooth changes in direction.

### 2-Closed-Loop Feedback:
Servos use a feedback mechanism, which allows them to maintain a specific position or adjust dynamically to changes. Where this will be important for real-time ball dribbling, where continuous adjustments are made.

### 3-Dynamic Response:
Depending on the size and power of the servo, you can get a change in speed and direction rapidly, which is essential for controlling the ball's movement effectively.

### 4-Simple Control:
Servo motors are easier to control compared to stepper motors, as they use PWM signals to command the position and speed. For basic dribbling applications where position control is critical, they can work well.


### The most prefered type of servo motor is the **continuous rotation**, this type does not have a limit on i
